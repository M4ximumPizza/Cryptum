# Cryptum - Encryption and Decryption Tool
(Encryption in Latin)

Cryptum is a simple Java application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text or files using various encryption algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing encryption and decryption operations, making it suitable for learning and practicing encryption techniques.

## Features
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Text**: Cryptum supports encryption and decryption of text using three different algorithms: Caesar Cipher, XOR Encryption, and Substitution Cipher.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Files**: Cryptum allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using the same algorithms supported for text encryption and decryption.
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Users can choose between different encryption algorithms to encrypt or decrypt their data, providing flexibility and learning opportunities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Cryptum provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing encryption and decryption operations, making it easy for users to encrypt and decrypt their data.

## Usage
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Text**:
    - Run the "Main" class.
    - Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt.
    - Select the encryption algorithm you want to use.
    - Choose whether you want to encrypt/decrypt text or a file.
    - Enter the text you want to encrypt/decrypt.
    - Cryptum will display the encrypted/decrypted text.

- **Encrypt and Decrypt Files**:
    - Run the "Main" class.
    - Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt.
    - Select the encryption algorithm you want to use.
    - Choose whether you want to encrypt/decrypt text or a file.
    - Enter the file path you want to encrypt/decrypt.
    - Cryptum will generate an encrypted/decrypted file based on your selection.
